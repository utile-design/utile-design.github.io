## Installing Plug-Ins

<Aside type="tip">You will only need to do this once. Plugins installed in QGIS are available to all projects.</Aside>

You'll now install a few plugins that will smooth some parts of your work in QGIS: [changeDataSource](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/changeDataSource/), [Project Packager](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ProjectPackager/), and [QuickMapServices](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/quick_map_services/).

<Steps>
    1. Navigate to the plugin management interface (`Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins...`)

    2. Select **Not Installed** to list available plugins that are not installed.

    3. Search for **changeDataSource**. This tool makes it easier to manage the data sources used by a given QGIS project, which will allow you to quickly move between projects in the GIS Database. Click **Install Plugin.**

    4. Search for **Project Packager**. This tool provides functionality that is much like Adobe Indesign's packaging functions---it takes all the data associated with a given project and packages it up alongside the project file. Click **Install Plugin.**

    4. Search for **QuickMapServices**. This tool provides many basemaps that are useful when interacting with spatial data, though they should not be used for final map outputs except when under severe time constraints. Click **Install Plugin.**

    5. Add **QuickMapServices** contributed pack by opening the package settings (`Web > QuickMapServices > Settings`). Navigate to the **More Services** tab and select **Get Contributed Pack**. This makes more basemaps available to you.

## Connecting to the Utile GIS Database

<Aside type="tip">You will only need to do this once. Database connections are stored by QGIS in a way that is not associated with any specific project.</Aside>

You'll now connect your QGIS software to the Utile GIS Database.

<Steps>
    1. Locate and right-click the **PostgreSQL** dropdown in the Browser Pane. Select **New Connection**.

    2. Fill out the prompt as follows:

        + **Name**: Utile GIS Database (or whatever makes sense to you---this is just a name you're giving the connection).
        + **Host**: The value of `DB_HOST` in your `.env` file. [If you have not received a `.env` file, request one!](/get_started#request-a-env-file).
        + **Database**: The name of the database for your project, generally a placename.
        + **Port**: The value of `DB_PORT` in your `.env` file.
        + **SSL Mode**: require
        + Ensure that **Also list tables with no geometry** is selected.

    3. Set up a credential configuration. Click the green plus sign under the Configurations tab.

    4. Fill out the prompt as follows and click save (where not specified, the defaults are fine):

        + **Name**: Utile Database Credentials
        + **Username**: The value of `DB_USER` in your `.env` file.
        + **Password**: The value of `DB_PASS` in your `.env` file.

    5. Click **Test Connection**. You should see a message saying **Connection to Utile GIS Database was successful**. If this is not the case, double-check your settings.

    6. Click **OK**. You can now drag in layers from the GIS database just like you can drag in shapefiles from a folder.

</Steps>
